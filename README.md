## 2. System Tests Corresponding to API

## 3. Unit Tests
  * The unit tests are located in src/test/java/FantasyBasketball, and test coverage is more than 90%

## 4. Style Compliant

   * Our team decided to use SonarLint to be able to view bug smells in addition to IntelliJ's built in style checker. We had also marked Sonarlint to ignore a few bugs that were appearing due to code in our project that was still underdevelopment and were necessary (for example: variables that were required to be snake case instead of camel case to communicate effectively with our Amazon RDS MySQL instance).

## 5. Build, Run, Test Instructions

   * First, make sure you have installed Maven.
       * (If you are on a Mac, you can try `mvn -v` to see what version of Maven you already have installed. Otherwise, you can run `brew install maven` to install.)
   * Next, execute the following command to install all the necessary dependencies to execute FantasyBasketballApplication: (Run these in /FantasyBasketball.)
       * `mvn install`
   * Finally, run the following command to run the FantasyBasketballApplication:
       * `mvn spring-boot:run`
   * (The above instructions were inspired by the following source: https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html)

## 1. Client

## 2. Continuous Integration

## 3. Coverage
   * Please find the results of our coverage testing in the directory called `CoverageTests`. It is provided as an HTML file. All coverage is above 85%.

## 4. Bug Finder
   * Our team decided to use SpotBugs to be able to view bug / code smells in addition to IntelliJ's built in style checker. Please see the results of our SpotBugs bug finder report in the directory called `BugCheckReport/`. It is provided as an HTML file. 
   * There are only two bugs, as we cleaned up the rest of the issues. We decided to leave the two bugs in the report for two reasons: 
      * 1) The bugs are not that serious, and we preferred our implementation over the preference of SpotBugs, and 
      * 2) SpotBugs did not allow us to export our bug finder report when we had 0 bugs.
